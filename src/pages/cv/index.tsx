                I've built on mobile and desktop games using <b>Unity Engine</b>. I also created full websites.</p>

              <p>During my training for WorldSkills 2019 competition, I've joined <i>Raadkish</i>
                as a front-end developer to improve my skills there. They were working on startup fintech and tourist services.
                I've learned to code in <b>React</b> and <b>React Native</b> to develop the front-end parts of their websites
                and applications. Working along with <i>Hadi Mostafapour</i> took me to another level of web development. It was a great
                experience to see how things can be done better and faster, and learn best practices and new technologies
                in web development.</p>

                job was to created a website to do this automatically. It was created with <b>Laravel</b> and <b>React</b>.
                A challenging part of this project was its' data entry forms, since there was a ton of nested and related forms
                which was addressed by creating a form scaffolding structure, to create all those forms based on their database
                structure. I also had to work with the Airport DCS APIs to get flights and passengers data.</p>
